## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the age of U.S. senators and the average age of their constituency. Furthermore, I would like to explore the stark divide between the overall mean of ages in the U.S. Senate and the overall mean of U.S. voters, particularly in the past 2020 presidential election. With this data, I would explore what ages and groups of voters are less represented within the U.S. Senate.
